# Postcss scss 

The setup of this repository is to be able to smoothly transition from scss to postcss and not need a postcss config. 

I think I was able to do it. Look at the [config](https://github.com/yowainwright/postcss-scss/blob/master/package.json#L32-L39) to decide for yourself! 

Thanks to [Craig Buckler](https://twitter.com/craigbuckler) for his great Sitepoint [post](https://www.sitepoint.com/postcss-sass-configurable-alternative/).
